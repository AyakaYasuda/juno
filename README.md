# Juno | Online Wedding Invitations App 

We've been looking to make wedding prep more enjoyable and stress-free through building a web app, then we decided to create an online wedding invitation app that allows couples to create a wedding invitation and manage REVPs effortless.
The features includes generating an invitation url for guests to fill out a RSVP, tracking guests' attendance, making a guest list... and also we're thinking of updating the app with new features! 

We welcome your feedbacks and ideas of features to improve the app :)  ðŸ‘° [VISIT APP HERE](https://juno-wedding.vercel.app) ðŸ’’
